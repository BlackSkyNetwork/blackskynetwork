                            echoing with mythological whispers, Black Sky Society's Aetheria (Skylab01) is creating a sanctuary for those who dare to imagine expansive futures. We invite extraordinary individuals to join us in bridging the material and metaphysical, the technological and spiritual, the ancient and the yet-to-come.

                            Aetheria is both a residency and an alchemical experiment. Here, among mountains that
                            have witnessed millennia
                            of human
                            dreams, we'll explore the evolution of consciousness, fringe science, warp physics,
                            and the
                            emerging post-web. We seek those who believe in creating a world of wonder,
                            resilience,
                            peace, and liberation – visionaries who understand that true innovation must be
                            rooted in
                            spiritual wisdom.

                                Nestled in the Cretan landscape, our compound exists in superposition of
                                past, present, and future. Mornings can be spent developing new knowledge protocols,
                                evenings stargazing from our rooftop, and weekends exploring ancient Greek and
                                Minoan sites.
                                Our space offers both solitude for deep work and community for cosmic exploration.

                                            Giulio is a repented scientist who used to work at places like CERN and the
                                            European Space Agency. He repented because he doesn't like the
                                            Thou-Shalt-Not diktats of the bureaucrats of science that he finds so
                                            annoying. He prefers the Yes-You-Can encouragements of highly imaginative
                                            scientists and engineers. He calls himself an irrational mechanic in protest
                                            against the bureaucrats of science that worship a logically flawed and
                                            obsolete form of “rationality.” He is on a crusade to show that good science
                                            is compatible with our weirdest aspirations and wildest dreams.

                                    <p>Our opening symposium establishes the foundational groundwork for interdisciplinary inquiry. Stella R. Magnet introduces Black Sky Society and the metaphysical architecture guiding our investigations, while Giulio Prisco virtually unveils the emerging street science of irrational mechanics. Anastasia Kriuchkova presents her analytical approach to astrological phenomena, followed by a Socratic dialogue exploring intersections between ancient wisdom, theology, frontier exploration, and humanity's evolving potential — culminating in a symposiastic banquet where discourse flows alongside sustenance.</p>

                                    <p>Noumenia, the ancient Greek celebration marking the beginning of each lunar month, becomes our inspiration. With the new moon as our guide, we open the first of our monthly lunar gatherings — Noumenia Oneira — a place to remember, reimagine, and realign. Anastasia guides us to draw rather than speak our intentions, using meditation and the five elements to create intuitive images. Daniela then conducts a live shamanic drum journey to transform image into energy and intention into path, beginning a lunar tradition of dreaming and activating with each New Moon. <i>(Note: In-person only)</i></p>

                                        The Psychro Cave in Crete carries a memory of the first apocalyptic passage of the gods that portends each technical recreation of the world. Hesiod tells of how the goddess Rhea "hid [Zeus] in a remote cave beneath the secret places of the holy earth", before Zeus led the Olympian gods to overthrow the old king Cronos and cast out the Titans.  In the Statesman (269c-274d), Plato presents a new version of this myth, in which the 'Divine Pilot' (Theios Kybernētēs) rationally controls a cosmic "living creature" (Anima Mundi), "endowed with reason" by the divine Mind (Nous), and "framed" by the architecture of celestial mechanics. The collapse of this cybernetic system - from the first age of Cronos, when "God was supreme governor", to this subsequent age of Zeus, when "the pilot of the ship of the universe" has "let go the handle of its rudder" - results in the "cosmic crisis" of mortality, and of an intergenerational loss of memory, which requires - as both a remedy and poison - Prometheus to steal the gift of fire, and Haphaestus to invent technology. Yet, as Plato warns (Phaedrus, 274b–279b), the invention of writing, as an external aid to memory (hypomnēsis), can, in contrast to living recollection (anamnēsis), also become an occasion for increased forgetting, and, in our age of digital computer writing, for the compounding meta-crises that afflict modernity.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Drawing on Diotima’s speech in Plato’s Symposium (201e-205e), Simone Weil developed a theory of mediation as the aesthetic self-limitation of cycles of destructive force, which she observed reaching their height in the technical-bureaucratic apparatuses of the 20th century.  While the erotic foundations of beauty are always structured around a lack, Weil calls for this lack to be oriented again towards its fulfilment in agapeic transcendence, which is preserved through a mystical decreation of our narcissistic imaginations, and which becomes ever-more concrete through an incarnational mediation of sacred harmonic and geometric correlations. Drawing, in a similar way on Henri Bergson's 'creative evolution', Teilhard de Chardin prophesied that the evolution of technical nature would culminate in the 'Omega-point' reversal of thermodynamic entropy, an ever-more ecstatic growth in the 'Noosphere' of celestial intelligence, and in the ultimate overcoming of Plato's 'cosmic crisis' through a free recognition of the 'hyperpersonality' that abides at the center of cosmotechnics and every cybernetic system. Join Anna K. Winters and Ryan Haecker on Saturday, 28th June from the island of Crete on a pilgrims journey from Simone Weil's modern re-activation of ancient insights to Teilhard de Chardin's techno-mystical vision of the hyperpersonality at the center of our world that sails on the vast ocean of spirit and life.

                                    <p>In this symposium, the interconnected intelligence of Earth's systems meets human potential through ancient practices. MN Finkelstein guides participants through plant meditation as a somatic and molecular practice, exploring phase transitions and becoming-with plants through the lens of both affect and chemistry.  Max Konstantinovsky examines how geospatial intelligence evolves into technologies that enhance Noospheric coherence and planetary awareness. Anahaa guides participants through Kriya Yoga to unlock dormant capacities, demonstrating how individual transformation ripples through the larger web of existence. This convergence reveals how personal practice becomes planetary healing.</p>

These same caves that once housed Minoan-era inhabitants and Roman generals became sanctuary for 1960s hippies seeking alternative ways of living—until they were expelled by conservative forces. We explore this liminal space where mythological transformation, ancient dwelling, and bohemian rebellion converge, investigating how places of power continue to attract those seeking liberation across millennia. The afternoon includes a seaside picnic and relaxed, off-the-record dialogue among these storied cliffs.</p>

                                    <p>Our final symposium examines sovereignty beyond current digital and political structures, exploring pathways toward truly autarkic systems that enable stellar civilization. Participants investigate the core challenges of <a href="https://postweb.nexus" target="_blank">post-web</a> development while identifying synergies between digital sovereignty and humanity's cosmic trajectory, guided by principles of Agape that unite technological liberation with universal love. The day concludes with a banquet featuring performances and poetry, followed by participants gathering on the sanctuary roof for our closing ritual beneath the Mediterranean stars—sharing visions, breakthrough insights, and psychodestined trajectories while sound healing frequencies carry intentions into the aetheric realm. The evening ends not with conclusions but with individual and shared futures taking shape beneath the cosmos.</p>

                                            Giulio is a repented scientist who used to work at places like CERN and the
                                            European Space Agency. He repented because he doesn't like the
                                            Thou-Shalt-Not diktats of the bureaucrats of science that he finds so
                                            annoying. He prefers the Yes-You-Can encouragements of highly imaginative
                                            scientists and engineers. He calls himself an irrational mechanic in protest
                                            against the bureaucrats of science that worship a logically flawed and
                                            obsolete form of “rationality.” He is on a crusade to show that good science
                                            is compatible with our weirdest aspirations and wildest dreams.

For over 15 years, her shamanic journey has unfolded through personal experiences and magical synchronicities, guided by her deep connection to animals, plants, and spirits. She and her husband built their sustainable life from scratch, reforesting their land in collaboration with Mother Earth.

                                            Stella R. Magnet, founder of Aetheria and co-founder of Black Sky Society,
                                            is Aetheria's primary resident. Her self-guided and experiential research over the last
                                            eight years has centered on cryptoeconomic network design related to
                                            large-scale cooperation networks. She has contributed governance,
                                            mechanisms, product, and vibes to over 10 different DAOs or open source projects. She's writing a book that explores her emerging path to transcendence through
                                            synchronicities connecting Philip K. Dick, VALIS, and Jack Parsons. The work chronicles her journey from
                                            substance abuse and bipolar disorder to understanding her consciousness, particularly its perception of apocalyptic timelines when peering into Parsons' Babalon working.</p>

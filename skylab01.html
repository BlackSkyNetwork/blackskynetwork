                                imagine expansive futures. We invite extraordinary individuals to join us in bridging

                                technological and spiritual, the ancient and the yet-to-come.

                            Aetheria is both a residency and an alchemical experiment. Here, among mountains that
                            have witnessed millennia
                            of human
                            dreams, we'll explore the evolution of consciousness, fringe science, warp physics,
                            and the
                            emerging post-web. We seek those who believe in creating a world of wonder,
                            resilience,
                            peace, and liberation – visionaries who understand that true innovation must be
                            rooted in
                            spiritual wisdom.

                                Nestled in the Cretan landscape, our compound exists in superposition of
                                past, present, and future. Mornings can be spent developing new knowledge protocols,
                                evenings stargazing from our rooftop, and weekends exploring ancient Greek and
                                Minoan sites.
                                Our space offers both solitude for deep work and community for cosmic exploration.

                                vegan meals, though those who eat meat can prepare it separately. Couples are welcome to
                                apply, but each person must submit their own application and demonstrate alignment with

                                            annoying. He prefers the Yes-You-Can encouragements of highly imaginative
                                            scientists and engineers. He calls himself an irrational mechanic in protest

                                            obsolete form of “rationality.” He is on a crusade to show that good science
                                            is compatible with our weirdest aspirations and wildest dreams.

                                            Breakers universe that explores her emerging path to transcendence through

                                            an inner calling to summon spacecraft. The work chronicles her journey from

                        <p>In a remote Greek village, surrounded by ancient olive groves and echoing with mythological
                            whispers, Black Sky Society's Skylab01 is creating a sanctuary for those who dare to
                            imagine expansive futures. For 90 days (March 16 - June 13, 2025), we invite four
                            extraordinary individuals to join us in bridging the material and metaphysical, the
                            technological and spiritual, the ancient and the yet-to-come.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            This is not just a residency –
                            it's an alchemical experiment. Here, among mountains that have witnessed millennia of human
                            dreams, we'll explore the evolution of consciousness, fringe science, warp physics, and the
                            emerging post-web. We seek those who believe in creating a world of wonder, resilience,
                            peace, and liberation – visionaries who understand that true innovation must be rooted in
                            spiritual wisdom.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            Nestled in the Cretan landscape, our compound exists in superposition of
                            past, present, and future. Mornings can be spent developing new knowledge protocols,
                            evenings stargazing from our rooftop, and weekends exploring ancient Greek and Minoan sites.
                            Our space offers both solitude for deep work and community for cosmic exploration.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            If you
                            feel called to merge spirituality with science, to bridge technology with ancient wisdom,
                            and to weave personal transformation into collective liberation – we invite you to join our
                            experiment.

                            <p>Skylab01 has a six bedroom compound in a remote mountain village on the island of Crete
                                in Greece.
                            </p>
                            The compound has 4 levels:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Garden level (0): Very large yard which can be used for gardening or art projects
                                </li>
                                <li>Residence (1): independent 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit</li>
                                <li>Residence (2): independent 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit</li>
                                <li>Rooftop (3): An expansive rooftop with a 360 degree view</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The village is very remote: it has no restaurants or grocery stores in walking distance,
                                so
                                residents should be comfortable spending the majority of the time at the residence,
                                sharing
                                cooking and grocery run duties.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ideal residents are seeking a monastic-like, quiet and peaceful atmosphere where people

                                to themselves and are not very talkative during agreed upon hours, yet share
                                conversation
                                during meals or group activities.

                                        Spring cohort. His recent book <a

                                        Futurist Science & a New Religion</span></a> explores the convergence of quantum
                                        physics,
                                        consciousness theory, and mystical traditions. During the residency, Prisco will
                                        lead a seminar on irrational mechanics and will also offer one-on-one (virtual)
                                        mentorship to residents interested in these topics.

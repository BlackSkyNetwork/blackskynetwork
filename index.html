              marked by Psychodestiny, where the veil of the present

              Post-web is an emerging vision for the future of internet

              private, resilient, and interoperable networks. 
              Privacy and individual sovereignty over personal 
              data are paramount. Additionally, we anticipate the 
              use of multiple cryptocurrencies through a heterogeneous, 
              privacy-preserving financial transport layer. 
              Rather than inventing a new blockchain ecosystem, 
              Post-web is a principles-based movement that will be 
              put into motion through a decentralized systems 
              engineering experiment, drawing upon open knowledge 
              and community research as the core of its development

              Furthermore, we are calling upon the support of individuals 
              and organizations with the capacity to fund our research network.

               <h3>SIX TENETS</h3>
              <h4>The Six Tenets of Black Sky Society are the 
                higher-level principles that align people to 
                be a part of our society, specifically when it 
                comes to approaching the Six Topics together. 
                We expect that, over time, we will find allied 
                organizations around our Six Topics. However, 
                whether one joins a Black Sky Society guild on a 
                longer-term basis is based on individual alignment 
                with these distinguishing tenets.</h4><br><br>
                <h5>
                  1. Transcendence: We are like ravens, connecting the physical world to the metaphysical world.
<br><br>
In our society, we recognize and celebrate the universal human quest for meaning, purpose, and transcendence. We do not expect the world at large to conform around our tenets, nor a singular conception of God. Instead, we encourage and support each individual's unique path towards understanding their place in the Cosmos, treating it like a science experiment, and emphasizing how this is important for both personal and societal transformation.
<br><br><br><br>
2. Adaptivity: Structured power dynamics tailored to mission, upholding personal freedom.
<br><br>
Our society is built upon the principles of structured and transparent power dynamics, eliminating any notion of exploitation. We strive to establish cooperative commonwealths with diverse leadership and ownership structures tailored to each mission. Unless we are developing an important public goods technology, outsiders don't need to know our leadership internals, but society members do. We uphold the right of every individual to personal freedom and their unique pursuit of happiness, allowing them to adaptively opt in and out of power structures based on their own goals and philosophies.
<br><br><br><br>
3. Interdependence: Many actions and thoughts can change reality in drastic ways.
<br><br>
Our society acknowledges the fundamental interdependence that exists within our world. We understand that many thoughts and action can have an equal and opposite reaction, and we are mindful of the interconnectedness of all things. We recognize that technological advancements can also impact food, water, neurological, and ecological systems in general. By embracing this understanding, we communicate and make choices analyzing many dimensions of impact, and opting for the path that contributes to the free evolution of humanity while promoting the most transformation, balance, and co-existence.
<br><br><br><br>
4. Liberty: Only if we believe peace is not impossible, can it become possible.
<br><br>
As a society, we are committed to promoting peace and increased freedom for as many people as possible, with a particular focus on supporting those most imprisoned based on the acceleration of the nation-state world model: e.g. nationless or otherwise displaced cultures, regions where people are living under war-mongering dictatorships or where women don't have equal rights. We strive to summon the world where every individual, regardless of background or circumstances, has the opportunity to thrive and lead a free, peaceful, and fulfilling life. We also recognize that you have to be in service to yourself before you have the energy to be in service to others, and that you shouldn't help those who don't welcome it.
<br><br><br><br>
5. Autonomy: Directness and honesty is more compassionate than polite people-pleasing.
<br><br>
In our society, we recognize the complexity of compassion. We do our best in cultivating empathy while acknowledging diverse expressions of self, considering neurological, cultural, hormonal, and generational differences. We foster an open-minded environment where everyone feels heard and respect is understood as multidimensional. We engage in difficult conversations and provide necessary criticism directly, viewing this as more genuinely compassionate than gossiping about others' shortcomings. While engaging in challenging discussions internally, we opt out of divisive culture wars, maintaining a long-term, systemic approach to addressing societal issues, recognizing that true progress requires sustained effort and understanding.
<br><br><br><br>
6. Resilience: We are self-repairing, where stressful events or failures only enable us to grow stronger.
<br><br>
As a society, we acknowledge that life is mysterious and complex, hence can be overwhelming and filled with uncertainty. We foster a culture of resilience, where individuals are encouraged to face adversity with courage, navigate challenges, reach out for support when afraid, and learn from their experiences. We put the pieces together, to learn from each scenario that generated friction, to build a society that minimizes stress as time passes, and thrives in the face of a world that is accelerating faster than we can easily comprehend.
